# bchydro-tweets

Python script using Twitter API to get BC Hydro tweets and output into csv file. If you want to run this
you will need your own Twitter API account and then can just replace the Twitter API oAuth credentials in 
the "tweet_auth-demo.py" file and then rename that file "tweet_auth.py" (that is what it is referred to as 
in the "bchtweets.py" file).
